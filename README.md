# Networking_Application_UDP_protocol_Implementation_Server_performing_Kmeans_clustering_over_datafile
a distributed networking application in Java consisting of a client and a server. The client will send a block of data to the server, the server will perform some computations and return the result to the client. The application should use Java’s UDP sockets (classes DatagramPacket and DatagramSocket and their methods) and provide the necessary reliable data transfer functionality on the top of UDP’s unreliable communication services by implementing the data transfer protocol. The server should perform K-means clustering on the received data vectors. K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which takes a number of input vectors and separates them into K clusters. In this case, there will be two clusters, so K = 2.
